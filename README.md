# TO_DO_LIST_APPLICATION
 A simple To-Do List Application helps users manage daily tasks by allowing them to add, view, and remove tasks. This project is an excellent way to practice Python fundamentals, such as working with lists, functions, loops, and conditionals.
 Create a Python script to manage a to-do list.
Implement a function to add tasks to the list.
Implement a function to display all tasks.
Implement a function to remove tasks from the list by task name or index.
Use loops to keep the program running until the user chooses to exit.
Optional: Implement a function to mark tasks as "completed" or "pending."
